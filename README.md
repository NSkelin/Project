## Overview
CartCompanion is a simple web application for keeping shopping lists online. It was made as part of our school curriculum, where we worked together as small groups of six to each create a unique project. The goal was to gain experience in a work-like environment over the course of 4 weeks.

## ScreenShots
As this app is no longer online, here are a few screenshots to get an idea of how it worked.
